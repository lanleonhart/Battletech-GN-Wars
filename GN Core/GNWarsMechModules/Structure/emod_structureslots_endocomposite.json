        "Details" : "Endo-Composite Structure is an experimental chassis technology developed by the Lyran Alliance in 3067. By mixing and matching standard and Endo-Steel components, Lyran engineers created a BattleMech skeleton that weighed 75% of a standard chassis but was only half as bulky as a traditional Endo-Steel system. This provides the 'Mech with more tonnage and frees enough room to keep a good weapons load. More importantly unlike the Composite internal structure developed by the Federated Suns, the Endo-Composite structure resists damage as effectively as a standard chassis.",
