        "Details": "Developed by the Terran Hegemony in 2487 and improved by the Clans after their Exodus, Clan Endo-Steel was designed especially for use in BattleMech skeletons. Using zero-G manufacturing techniques that uniformly mix high-density steel with lower-density titanium and aluminum, the process produces a metal twice as strong per unit of weight as standard skeleton materials, thus halving the weight of the chassis, but at an increase in overall bulk. Occupies 7 Endo-Steel slots but halves your internal structure weight.",
