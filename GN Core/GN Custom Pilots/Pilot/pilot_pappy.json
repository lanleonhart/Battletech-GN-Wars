    "Details": "Gerald 'Pappy' Pitkin is the founder of the Pitkin Lancers. A former rancher from the Outworlds Alliance, he formed the unit using  BattleMechs and equipment captured from the SLDF 27th Royal Brigade. Though only 48 years old, Pappy is seen as an elder by many Mechwarriors, who tend to live short lives. A self taught pilot, Pappy tends to be unpredictable in his fighting style. He is also known for using whatever materials are at hand to the maximum effect, scrounging together weapons from salvage others would see as garbage. Pappy went solo after the Lancers were dissolved shortly after the founding of the Raven Alliance.  <-- Bio goes in side the quotes",
