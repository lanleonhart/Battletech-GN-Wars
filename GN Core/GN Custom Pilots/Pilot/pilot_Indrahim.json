    "Details": "Indrahim was born on Terra, into a family with a long tradition of serving ComStar and the Com Guards. It even reached back to the old days of the Star League and the SLDF. Due to this, his career path was clear, serving as the sword and shield of ComStar and he was drilled from an early age to do so.\n Both his grandfather and father teached him the art of war and how to be a solider, while his mother told him many stories of the glorious days of the Star League. His knack for history comes from his parents. He got his first rifle at the age of 10 and learned how to shoot and service it. \n\n During his days in Sandhurst, Indrahim managed to get into the top 10% of the officer recruits. In his vacations he returned home and was trained to become a MechWarrior and maintenance his mech, an old Icarus II. This mech would become his after his graduation. He was assigned to the 102nd Com Guards Division, the “Vigilant Thought”.\n\nIn his new unit, he served his way up to Demi-Precentor and fought the Clans in Operation Bulldog. Later on he fought in the FedCom Civil War against the forces of Katherine Steiner-Davion on a few occasions, although he wanted to stay neutral in this conflict. After it's conclusion, he hunted down pirates in the periphery.\n\n In 3067 he transferred to the Explorer Corps and started his journey into the Periphery and beyond, searching for relics and new information from and about the Star League. He came back to the Inner Sphere after the Word of Blake Jihad, finding ComStar only a shadow of its former glory and size. With the 102nd Division gone in the flames of the war, he set his new goal to rebuilding his old unit and became their Precentor. \n He was a quiet man, seldom raising his voice. He had a moral code that he adhered to and wanted others to strife to be better today than they were yesterday. Although he managed to lead by example, his attitude was sometimes met with doubt. He tried to see everything from a neutral standpoint, trying to be the moral compass for his division. \n",
