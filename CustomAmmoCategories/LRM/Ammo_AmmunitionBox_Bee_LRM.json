		"Details": "Created as a way to affect enemy forces with detrimental effects, the Battlefield Effectiveness and Endurance Suppressor ammuniton, called BEES ammo, was not a large hit when released to the open market. Though it does reduce the target's movement and accuracy thanks to ECM countermeasures built into the warhead, it does minimal damage and has an alarming tendency to hit nearby allies as well. It found only niche acceptance and was quickly forgotten by most militaries. Upon receiving a Critical Hit, any remaining ammunition stored inside an Ammo Bin will explode dealing damage to the install location. Risk can be mitigated with the use of C.A.S.E. Has 120 shots.",
