    "Details": "A semi-perpetual generator, scaled for installation on a mobile suit, which harnesses the byproducts of baryonic decay as an energy source. Like every other power source, a GN Drive has a limited moment-by-moment output; however, due to its very nature, a GN Drive will continue to supply power for a theoretically infinite period of time, so long as the GN drive is not pushed to breaking limits. This tech is a tier above even the golden age of the Star League. ",
