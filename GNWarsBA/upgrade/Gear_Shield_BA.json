		"Details": "Designed for the Achilles battle armor suit, the Battle Armor Shield proved potent and durable in the field, if somewhat cumbersome for the trooper to carry around. The BA Shield was shown to increase the durability of troopers in the field by almost 10% but due to its weight limited the offensive capabilities of the carrying suit. The BA Shield was eventually quietly shelved, only being ever deployed on the Achilles.",
