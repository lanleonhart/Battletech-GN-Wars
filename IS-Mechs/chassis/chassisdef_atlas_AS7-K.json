The 'Mech's role was shifted, evolving from a short-ranged brawler into a powerful ranged sniper. Though the AS7-K was more fragile due to its XL engine and volatile Gauss Rifle, the amount of firepower it could project at range was truly intimidating for its era. Its largest flaw, however, was one that plagued many Kuritan 'Mechs of the era. Difficulties in producing Double Heat Sinks forced the Combine to mount basic models onto this Atlas, limiting its heat dissipation abilities. These Atlases would not only see deployment in House Kurita's forces, but spread to the other signatories of the Concord of Kapteyn and other minor powers of the Inner Sphere.",
