The NAIS came back to the military with this, the SWD-4. While it was not as cutting-edge as the AFFS originally desired, it was extremely effective in combat and the AFFS was pleased. The mech proved so effective that it was later put onto the open market and found many buyers among the small government and mercenary markets. Armed with a pair of MML-5s and a Light AC/5 as well as a triplet of ER Medium Lasers, the SWD-4 can engage at any range effectively.",
