		"Details": "The Whitworth is something of an ugly duckling, known among both critics and fans as the Whitworthless. It was originally produced in 2610 as a BattleMech that was meant to fill the weight gap between the lighter Wasp and the heavier Phoenix Hawk 'Mechs despite being slower than both. This variant of the Whitworth introduced in 3068 upgrades the WTH-1S Whitworth. The chassis has been redesigned to use Endo Steel construction techniques and one of the Medium Lasers have been downgraded to a Small Laser. The SRM-6s were removed and the fourteen single heat sinks were upgraded to ten double heat sinks. The saved weight was used to add four Streak SRM-4 launchers, a C3 Slave Unit, and CASE to protect the 'Mech from ammunition explosions.",
