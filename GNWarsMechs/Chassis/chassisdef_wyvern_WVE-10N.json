The 'Mech's speed, jumping capabilities, and LRM-10 with CASE-protected ammo have been retained, but otherwise everything else has changed. The 10N carries eight tons of standard armor. The primary weapon has been changed from a large pulse laser to an ER PPC, while one of the medium pulse lasers and the Streak launcher was dropped. The Wyvern has also had a Guardian ECM Suite installed as well as an improved C3 computer to allow it to use targeting telemetry from its comrades.",
