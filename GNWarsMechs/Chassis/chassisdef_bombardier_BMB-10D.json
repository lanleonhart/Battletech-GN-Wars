		"Details": "During the Succession Wars, many Star League-era Bombardiers were refit to the lower technology levels of the time, resulting in the BMB-10D. The -10D is much like the original -12D, but where the -12D has double heat sinks, CASE, and an XL engine, the -10D removes all those components. The loss of the XL engine lead to the the mech being forced to use a slower engine core, losing 20 kph from its top speed. The armament stayed much the same, though the AMS was swapped out for a Machine Gun. Otherwise, the thin ammo and large LRM racks remain from the -12D. The BMB-10D was not a well-received design and was often relegated to training duties.",
