In a quirk of fate, on the same day that Coventry had the modified Blitzkrieg on the weapon ranges testing the Bombast Laser a ranking LCAF general was visiting the facility for requisition talks. He saw the modified mech on the ranges and was impressed, immediately placing an order for a dozen of them after assuming it was an up-coming design. Coventry, ever clever, rolled with it and made it a release variant. The BTZ-6F mounts twin Bombast Lasers and a battery of bonus heatsinks. The heat is tremendous but the Bombasts let the pilot 'dial in their heat' to a degree.",
