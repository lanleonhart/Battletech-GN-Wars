The original variant, the primitive BKX-1X, was oddly a much better balanced mech than its later 'upgrades'. Armed with two each of Large Lasers, LRM-5s, and Machine Guns, with a solitary SRM-6, the BKX-1X had a weapon for all ranges. 19 standard heat sinks kept the mech moderately cooled and it was acceptably armored for its era. It was slow, but so was war back then.",
