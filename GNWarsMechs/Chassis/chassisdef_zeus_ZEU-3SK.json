		"Details": "Designed as a rapid reaction Heavy Killer, the ZEU-3SK was meant to fill the need of Periphery States requiring an assault that could provide enough of a punch to put down any aggressive pirate leader, and enough speed to get to where the fight was needed. Armed with a dual-purpose loadout, a Medium Rifle and trio of Medium Lasers provide consistent firepower as a Flamer defends against pesky infantry. However, for close-range punch, the ZEU-3SK carries a Reloading RL 40 and a Heavy Cannon, as well as four Jump Jets to ensure it can get behind enemies with the one-shot weapons. In the end the ZEU-3SK was not very successful, being compared to the far more reliable and longer lasting Victor, and fell out of favor.",
