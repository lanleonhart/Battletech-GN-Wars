To that end, it was built entirely around gathering data and getting out of trouble, tasks for which it is exceptional. The realities of this mission meant that it lacked in offensive capability, with most Ostscouts having little in the way of weaponry. While the sensor suite is second-to-none and of incredible quality, the weapons on the mech are limited, at best. A single Tronel-brand Medium Laser is all the defense the mech has. The Royal Ostscout-7Jb is the only variant of the mech before the 3050s and uses an Endo-Steel structure to free up weight for a Beagle Active Probe.",
