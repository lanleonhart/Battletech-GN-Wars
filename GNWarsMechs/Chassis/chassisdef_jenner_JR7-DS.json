It was armed with two Medium VSP Lasers and an MML5, fed by one ton bins of LRM and SRM ammo and driven by an XXL 250 engine. Nonetheless, several major compromises were made for ease of production, such as use of basic missile munitions and use of Composite Structure instead of Endo Steel. Though the plans for massive production runs not seen since the days of the Star League were optimistic to begin with and fell apart completely with the start of the FedCom Civil War, a production license was obtained by Corean Enterprises and their facilities on Augusta and Stewart continuously made small production runs until 3070.",
