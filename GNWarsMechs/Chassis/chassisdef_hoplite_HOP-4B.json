The 4B variant of the Hoplite is an early variant of the 'Mech that attempts to both alleviate the ammunition dependence of its primary weapon and increase its long-range damage potential. This is done by mounting a PPC as the primary weapon that is backed up by a LRM-15 launcher with two tons of reloads.",
