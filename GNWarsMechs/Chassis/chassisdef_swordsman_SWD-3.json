Though the design had been out of production for centuries, the Swordsman was floated as a good fit and was approved by First Prince Victor Davion. Thanks to newly rediscovered Star League technologies, the Swordsman SWD-3 benefits from endo-steel construction and double heat sink cooling. The weapons load is fairly mundane, with a UAC/5 and LRM-10 for long range engagements and a pair of Medium Lasers for close-range combat. CASE protects the mech's 3 tons of ammo. The SWD-3 was a fair success and prompted a handful of upgrades later on.",
