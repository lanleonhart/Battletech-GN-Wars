Eventually it was rebuilt in 2549 to serve as a light support platform thanks to the first-ever use of Endo-Steel and CASE on a mech. Supplied by ComStar to the Draconis Combine as part of Operation Rosebud in 3035, the THE-S was a downgraded factory refit of the THE-N. Developed in 3038 by the Draconis Combine in an attempt to upgrade the 'Mech's short range firepower prior to the War of 3039, the THE-T is a field refit of the downgraded THE-S that swaps out the LRM launcher for an SRM-4.",
